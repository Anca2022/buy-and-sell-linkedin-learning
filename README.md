# BuyAndSell

This project was created following a course on LinkedIn Learning as a means to practice the Angular framework. The goal of the project is to implement a simple selling webpage where users can browse through various items to buy. The backend part of the site is missing. 
The items used to populate the pages were retrieved from Contentful API. 
This project was generated with Angular CLI version 17.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
